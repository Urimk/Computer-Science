To compile and run the project, ant is needed, I added a compiled version so it can be skipped.
To compile with ant: and compile.
To run: ant run. *for some reason this does not work, so in the bin folder, run java Arkanoid.
To choose the levels to run, add numbers (1 to 4) for example: java Arkanoid 1 2 3 4 1

Enjoy!
